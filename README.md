# Laboratory 

This repository will hold an application programming interface used by laboratory personel. 

## Background 

This repository will hold a very important tool to TC Laboratory personel. Not only will it allow TC personel to quickly start or stop TC Servers on the TC Network, it will also help facilitate communication between TC Clients and services available throughout the network.

This repository was developed in part for use during the instruction of basic and advanced programming principles. These are the core fundamentals to programming techniques and paradigms. The following topics are implemented into the projects: 

  - Program Structure
  - Packages / Imports
  - Input / Output
  - Execution   
  - Documentation 
  - Naming Conventions 
  - Functions
  - Scoping
  - Variables 
  - Conditions
  - Looping  
  - Abstraction 
  - Encapsulation 
  - Inheritance 
  - Parallelism
